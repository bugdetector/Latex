\chapter{System Analysis}
Project details and descriptions of modules in this section.
This project will contains a mobile application which saves user location, media files and organize an event with other people, and a serves side application which provides users to interact, sharing saved contents and access shared contents. 

Mobile application will saved location, notes and media files also location of media files to storage when user started trip tracking feature of mobile application. Before starting a trip user can choose some of his/her friends to organize a trip with them on the both online and offline modes. If searching friend is not listed on offline mode, user can add friend when internet connection provided. If a person added a trip, this person will give a notification which asks user to accept joining or reject joining to trip. If user accepted invitation he/she can join trip as a member. Invitor is accepted as leader of team. During the trip all user's behavior saved seperately. If location sharing feature opened any member of this team can watch other members location. But as we mentioned this feature requires internet connection. At the end of trip when user want to share his/her trip data and all of the data shared by other members will be merged. All users can select sharing data seperately. As a result anyone could wants to store a picture but don't want to share. 

In order to save location on background Android application will use a location saving service. Using service is a must because, Android services provides to execute a process for long time on the background. User can watch his/her location path on map during trip. If user wants to track a path which is shared from other people user can track the path by looking at map.
