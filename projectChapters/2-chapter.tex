As mentioned before, the application will have social media feature. In order to do that we have server and client side platforms. Server side will be stored on AWS(Amazon Web Service) servers. Another server will store the data in database which is also located in AWS servers. A responsive and single page web site will be designed for the users who wants to connect from their devices such as desktops, laptops, tablets and so on. We use Bootstrap for designing patterns, Angular JS and JQuery JavaScript frameworks to handle two-way data binding front-end development, for the back-end we will use Spring Boot STS Framework of Java, lastly for storing the data we will use MySQL relational database management system.
