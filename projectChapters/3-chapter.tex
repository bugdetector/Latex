This system needs requirements listed below:
\begin{itemize}
    \item This system needs real time location of user. So this system needs to run on mobile devices.
    \item This system must provide interaction within users. So to provide intraction of multiple mobile devices this system needs a server side application.
    \item In process of development to provide version controlling Git must used as VCS.
\end{itemize}

\section{Technic Feasibility}
As technical feasibility study, the software and hardware needs for the project is defined on the following sections.
\subsection{Software Feasibility}

In this project a web and a mobile application will be developed. The following software
technologies will be used.

\textbf{Mobile Side Development}
\newline
The tools and development environments used for mobile side development of the
project are mentioned below.
\newline
• Android: Android is a mobile operating system based on the Linux kernel. Its
source code is licensed under open source licenses and it is developing by Google
and Open Handset Alliance. The top layer of Android’s architecture is called
The Application Framework layer and it provides many higher-level services to
applications in the form of Java classes. Android was chosen over iOS because
of publishing problems, restrictions and lack of design guidelines that come with
iOS\cite{android}.
\newline
• Android Studio: Android Studio is the official IDE for Android application
development, based on IntelliJ IDEA. Android Studio offers some advantages
over Eclipse, such as Gradle based flexible build system, advanced layout editor,
built-in Git source control and Maven library support\cite{androidStudio}.
\newline

• Android Sqlite Database: SQLite is a opensource SQL database that stores data to a text file on a device. Android comes in with built in SQLite database implementation. SQLite supports all the relational database features\cite{androidStudioSqlite}.
\newline

• Android Emulator: Android emulator lets prototype, develop and test Android applications without using a physical device\cite{androidEmulator}.
\newline

• Google Map API: Google Maps APIs give developers several ways of embedding Google Maps into web pages or retrieving data from Google Maps, and allow for either simple use or extensive customization\cite{googleMapAPI}.
\newline

\textbf{Server Side Development}

The tools and development environments used for server side development of the
project are mentioned below.
\newline
• Java EE: Java EE is a collection of technologies and APIs for the Java platform designed to support "Enterprise" Applications which can generally be classed as large-scale, distributed, transactional and highly-available applications designed to support mission-critical business requirements. \cite{javaEETanim}
We have chosen JAVA EE platform because it is widely used by developers, its community is larger than most of its competitors, also it is a better option to use same language which is Java for the server side and mobile side development


• Eclipse: Eclipse platform which provides the foundation for the Eclipse IDE is composed of plug-ins and is designed to be extensible using additional plug-ins. Developed using Java, the Eclipse platform can be used to develop rich client applications, integrated development environments and other tools. \cite{eclipseTanim}
Eclipse can be used as an IDE for any programming language for which a plug-in is available. Eclipse has support for JAVA EE and Spring projects within its marketplace there are few IDEs that have these functionalities but Eclipse is open source and free.


• Sublime Text: Sublime Text is a proprietary cross-platform source code editor with a Python application programming interface (API). It natively supports many programming languages and markup languages, and functions can be added by users with plugins, typically community-built and maintained under free-software licenses. \cite{sublimeTanim}
Sublime Text is one of the greatest text editor in the world, almost every programming language is supported, we chosen it because of its Angular JS editing skills.


• MySQL : A database is a structured collection of data. It may be anything from a simple shopping list to a picture gallery or the vast amounts of information in a corporate network.
\cite{mySQLTanim}
 MySQL is open-source and free. Developers didn't need to pay licence fee, also it gets updates regularly which makes it reliable.


• MySQL Workbench: MySQL Workbench is a unified visual tool for database architects, developers, and DBAs. MySQL Workbench provides data modelling, SQL development, and comprehensive administration tools for server configuration, user administration, backup and many more features. \cite{mySQLWorkTanim}
It is best option for MySQL development platform, when we compare to others such as Apache PhpMyAdmin it contains reverse and forward engineering tools, embedded uml diagram chart drawer tools, generating tables from models without complexity.


• Bootstrap: Bootstrap is a front-end development framework that enables developers and designers to quickly build fully responsive websites. The framework contains global CSS settings with built-in components and extensible classes in the form of typography, navigation, buttons and many other html elements.\cite{BootstrapTanim}
 We have chosen bootstrap because bootstrap equals platform in dependency, by developing on Bootstrap developers are able to run their code on every size of device such as phones,tables,computers,laptops and so on.


• Angular JS: AngularJS is a MVVM platform.  AngularJS is a structural framework for dynamic web applications. It lets you use HTML as your template language and lets you extend HTML’s syntax to express your application's components clearly and succinctly. AngularJS’s data binding and dependency injection eliminate much of the code you would otherwise have to write.\cite{AngularJSTanim}
 We have chosen Angular JS because it is officially supported and created by the Google. What that means is that it is more reliable than others. Also it has more libraries than other frameworks its community larger than others.

• Javascript : Javascript is a dynamic computer programming language. It is lightweight and most commonly used as a part of web pages, whose implementations allow client-side script to interact with the user and make dynamic pages. It is an interpreted programming language with object-oriented capabilities.\cite{JavascriptTanim}
 We have chosen it because it is almost only option for front end development. 

• Apache Tomcat : The Apache Tomcat software is an open source implementation of the Java Servlet, Java Server Pages, Java Expression Language and Java Web Socket technologies. The Java Servlet, Java Server Pages, Java Expression Language and Java WebSocket specification are developed under the Java Community Process.\cite{TomcatTanim}
 We have chosen Apache Tomcat because it is platform independent, we can run web server in a Linux machine. 

• Spring Framework :  The Spring Framework provides a comprehensive programming and configuration model for modern Java-based enterprise applications - on any kind of deployment platform.
\cite{SpringFrameTanim}
 A key element of Spring is infrastructural support at the application level: Spring focuses on the "plumbing" of enterprise applications so that teams can focus on application-level business logic,without unnecessary ties to deployment environments. Spring framework makes things easy for developers, such as creating Web Services, Controllers, web pages, database integrations, query implementations and so on. It is easy because most of the trivial processes are implemented by the framework, for example you don't need to open and close database connections by yourself when you execute a query in JAVA it is done by Spring it makes code less complex.

• STS: The Spring Tool Suite is an Eclipse-based development environment that is customized for developing Spring applications. It provides a ready-to-use environment to implement,debug,run,and deploy your Spring applications,including integrations for Pivotal tc Server, Pivotal Cloud Foundry, Git, Maven, AspectJ, and comes on top of the latest Eclipse releases. 
\cite{STSTanim}
We have chosen STS because it has embedded Eclipse plug-in integrated, there are other options such as Spring Incubator web page, but when you use others you have to implement some extra steps to import those projects in your local computer.

• Postman : API development tool that is a plug-in which comes as a packaged application in Chrome and is used to test the api services. Users can test the JSON REST based Web Services with this and make a API for cross device applications. 
\cite{PostmanTanim}
We have chosen Postman because its perfect GUI. You can save your REST calls and look it from other computers by registering. 

• Google Map API: Google Maps APIs give developers several ways of embedding Google Maps into web pages or retrieving data from Google Maps, and allow for either simple use or extensive customization\cite{googleMapAPI}. 
We have chosen Google Map API because it is free for the first 100.000 requests.

• PuTTy : PuTTY is a Telnet and SSH terminal software for Unix and Windows platforms that enables any users to remotely access computers over the internet. 
\cite{PuttyTanim}
We have chosen PuTTy because it is platform independent and free.

• VNC : Virtual network computing (VNC) is a type of remote-control software that makes it possible to control another computer over a network connection. Keystrokes and mouse clicks are transmitted from one computer to another, allowing technical support staff to manage a desktop, server, or other networked device without being in the same physical location. 
\cite{VNCTanim}
We have chosen TightVNC as a tool for accessing remote server. TightVNC is also free and it is recommended by the community.

• WinSCP : This program is an open source free S FTP client, FTP client, Web DAV client and SCP client for Windows. Its main function is file transfer between a local and a remote computer.
\cite{WinSCPTanim}
 WinSCP is better option with its GUI for accessing remote file system. 

\subsection{Hardware Feasibility}
The minimum and recommended hardware requirements for each program/IDE and
a system requirement compilation for development is shown in Table 3.1 based on
the requirements.

For this project we selected to rent a cloud computing system for make this project scalable. Scaleway\cite{scaleway} provides cloud computing services. Scaleway can provide multiple datacenters on different locations and developer tools on the machines. We selected scaleway for renting cloud server(s). Starter package is enough for this project at startup.

\subsection{Communication Feasibility}

Media files and path files are seperately stored on users android device. It so hard to send all of trip data one by one to one device to another without any loss. So we thought about that to compressing all files in a zip file before sending from mobile device to web server or vice versa. So we sended all data in one file. Also we will use less data bandwidth with compress all files in a zip file.
The Internet is the main communication technology used in this project. The
anticipated communication variables are shown in Table \ref{table:commparameters}.

\end{table}


I = G * F + E * D + C * B + A

J = I * H

K = I * (1-R)

N = I * L

O = J * M

S = O + N

Based on the calculations above, the monthly data size will be around 10 GB. Scaleway provide 2 GB ram and 50 GB storage with expandable options. As a result these properties are sufficent.

\section{Labor Force Feasibility}
There are two people needed for developing mobile and server side of system concurrently.

\section{Legitimate Feasibility}
Software which is used within the project does not face any legal issues. All of the
software used in the project contain license requirements. Users are responsible for
all shared content. The users are responsible of their well being. So any misusing of 
any sharing content is their risk. So sharing and publishing content is on their own risk.


\section{Economic Feasibility}
The salary determined by the government of the Republic of Turkey for engineers
is 3.500 TL\cite{muhendisMaas}. The amount of assumed work days in a month is 21 days. The
individual and general cost of the personnel and features
the cost of hardware and software used for development are shown below.

\end{table}
The cost of computers used in the development process in 3181 TL\cite{dell}. In the process 2 computer were used. A computer can be used for 2 years so 48 months in average lifetime. From here, we will find the cost of computer as 662TL. General Mobile GM6 used in the development process is 900 TL\cite{gm6}. It can be used for 12 months in average lifetime. From here we will find the cost of phone as 375 TL. Considering these expenditures, the cost of development of our project is X TL.
