\chapter{Introduction}
On this project our purpose is saving navigation data of users and show the path of a trip on the map. There will be a mobile application and server side for provide some features, lets users to share trips, review trips, communicate and socialize each others. Various media records such as photos, videos and audio recordings recorded from mobile device during the trip will be shown on the route. If the journey is planned according to more than one member, there will be a team trip option for the members. This feature will requires use the internet connection to share real time locations between each team member. This feature lets every team member to see any team member's location simultaneously. In order to determine what method the system will be able to use for navigation, temporal changes of the positions taken from the satellite will be recorded, from which the speeds will be calculated, and as a result, trip type will be labelled as vehicle trip, walking trip, running trip or cycling trip. If the system is operating in the guiding role, the route that the user or team wants to go will be described by the system to the user. A social media environment will be designed. People will be able to establish their friendship here. In the news flow, there will be a timeline section. Posts which is shared by friends of users will be shown there.
