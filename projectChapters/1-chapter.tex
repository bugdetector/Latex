\chapter{Introduction}
On this project our purpose is to save navigation data which represents latitude, longitude and altitude provided by GPS of users and show the route of a trip on the map. There will be a mobile application and server side application to provide some features, lets users to share trips, review trips, communicate and socialize with each others. Various media records such as photos, videos and sound records recorded from mobile device during the trip will be shown on the route. There will be a team trip option for the trips which includes more than one member. Team trip option lets every team member to see any team member's location simultaneously if there is an internet connection. In order to determine travelling method, using the temporal data changes of the navigation data taken from the satellite, average and instant speed will calculated. As result, trip type will be labelled as vehicle trip, walking trip, running trip or cycling trip using calculated speed data. If the system is operating in the guiding mode, the route that the user or team wants to go will be described by system to user. In order to provide interaction between users a social media environment will be designed. People will be able to establish their friendship here. In the news flow, there will be a timeline section. Posts which are shared by friends of users will be shown there. The trips can be liked by other users in the news flow, it can be saved for future review, it can be suggested for other friends to visit, or the users can follow trips they like from its content by downloading it on their own mobile device.
\section{Literature Review}
Our purpose to realize that project is to simplify planning, recording and sharing of a trip for traveler. We know that it is not easy to organize photos and media taken on a trip and sharing them on Facebook. In any marketplaces including play store and appstore there are a lot of applications for tracking and travel planning but most of them only saves location data and do not include media or user notes. There are only a few remarkable application which saving location data, media and also providing a social media enviroment. However there is no application that provides trip tracking, organizing media, following other person's route, sharing memories and also doing all of these with friends at the same time. 

\section{Objective of the Thesis}
For travelers it is not easy to organize media and associate media with saved locations. Also if trip has been organized with more than one person it is also difficult to merge media and organize additional material prior to share on any social media enviroment or on the internet. It's important to say that every member of team has him/her own memory which is important and it must be saved.

\section{Hypothesis}
To do that it is neccessary to store locations data, store media and associate them with their location,and store them with everthing in a trip. So that people can remember a everthing in a trip.
